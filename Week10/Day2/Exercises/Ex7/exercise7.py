# Exercise 7 : Upcoming Holiday
# Instructions
# Write a function that displays todayâ€™s date.
# The function should also display the amount of time left from now until the next upcoming
# holiday and print which holiday that is. (Example: the next holiday is in 30 days and 12:03:45 hours).
# Hint: Start by hardcoding the datetime and name of the upcoming holiday.
