# 5. What is inheritance?
# Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
# 6. What is multiple inheritance?
# When a class is derived from more than one base class.
# 7. What is polymorphism?
# Answer: Allows us to define methods in the child class with the same name as defined in their parent class.
# 8. What is method resolution order or MRO?
# Answer: It's a method which shows the order of implementing classes' functions


# Part 2: Create A Deck Of Cards Class.
# The Deck of cards class should NOT inherit from a Card class.
#
# The requirements are as follows:
#
# The Card class should have a suit (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades) and a value (A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K)
# The Deck class :
# should have a shuffle method which makes sure the deck of cards has all 52 cards and then rearranges them randomly.
# should have a method called deal which deals a single card from the deck. After a card is dealt, it should be removed from the deck.
