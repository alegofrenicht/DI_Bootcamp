# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 1 : Human
# Instructions
# Create a class Human, it has the following attributes:
# name (str)
# age (int)
# living_place (Building - Default is None)
#
# Create another class Building, it has the following attributes:
# address (str)
# inhabitants (List of Human objects - Default is empty)
#
# Create a class City, it has the following attributes:
# name (str)
# buildings (List of Building objects - Default is empty)
#
# Add the move(self, building) method to the Human class, it sets the living place of this human to the building and add this human to the building inhabitants.
# Add the construct(self, address) method to the City class, it adds a building at the referenced address.
# Add the info(self, address) method to the City class, it displays the number of buildings and the mean age of the citizens.
# Created objects and call the methods
