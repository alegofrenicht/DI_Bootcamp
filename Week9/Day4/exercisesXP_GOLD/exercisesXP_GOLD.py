# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 1: Door
# 1. Create a Door class, it has only the following attributes:
#       id (int) : An id number, use a class variable objs that counts how many door have been created so far and use this number as the id of the door.
#       locked (boolean)
#       next (List of Door obs) : The next doors available from this one
#
# 2. Create a method can_go_to(self, other_door) in the Door class that checks if the path from this door to other_door can be made (the locked doors cannot be opened !).
#
# 3. Bonus: Display the path
# 4. Bonus 2: Add an integer variable KEYS that holds a limited number of keys available to open locked doors (each key can be used only once).
